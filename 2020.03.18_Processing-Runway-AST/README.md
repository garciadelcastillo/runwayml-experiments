Read comments in the code on how to run these sketches. 

A quick example to manually connect Processing to RunwayML and receive an
Adaptive Style Transfer prediction using an HTTP request. 

Instructions:
  - Download and install RunwayML: https://runwayml.com/ (tested with Beta v.0.10.32)
  - Open a new workspace, and add the Adaptive-Style-Transfer model to your workspace. 
  - Run it (probably remotely, deploying it locally requires some additional setup).
  - Run this sketch.
  - (If it is the dirst time you do it, set the correct value for `cameraID`, see below)
  - Press any key to take a snapshot.
  - Wait to receive the prediction from Runway. 
  - Copies of the snapshots were saved to this sketch folder.
