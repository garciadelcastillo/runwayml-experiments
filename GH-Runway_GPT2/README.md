# grasshopper-runway-gpt2

Read comments in the code on how to run this experiment. 

This file contains a definition that takes text from a panel, and requests a TV spot script prediction from RunwayML running _Cannes-Case-Generator_ model. 

Requirements: check main repo `README.md`

Instructions:
- Open a new workspace, and add the Cannes-Case-Generator model to your workspace. 
- Run it (probably remotely).
- Open this definition. The model should be queried right away!

Things should work as in the attached video files :)

The definition requires the `jSwan` plug-in by Andrew Heumann.
