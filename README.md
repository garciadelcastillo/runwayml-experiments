### Tutorial

If you want to learn more about RunwayML and interoperability with Grasshopper and Processing, I taught an online workshop as part of my class [SCI-6365: Enactive Design, Creative Applications through Concurrent Human-Machine Interaction](https://www.gsd.harvard.edu/course/enactive-design-creative-applications-through-concurrent-human-machine-interaction-spring-2020/) Spring 2020 at the Harvard Graduate School of Design. Recording is [here](https://youtu.be/CDHmkUUf_1U).
